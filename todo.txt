- make content container wider at larger screen sizes so you can put wider stuff in them
  - make features in showcase nice and wide on wider screen sizes
- rewrite story section. use interview notes for reference
- add more features to feature showcase, then record videos of them in action (or have scrolling images that show them (like that slick js))
