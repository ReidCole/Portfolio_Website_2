      <p>
        I&apos;ve been into technology, especially software, ever since I was a little kid. I
        remember trying to jailbreak several devices of mine back then just because I thought it was
        so cool that you could customize devices beyond what was originally intended. I also spent
        much of my time using sites like YouTube and Facebook, and I was always curious about how
        they worked behind the scenes. When it came time for me to choose a career path, coding
        seemed only natural for me, since it follows that curiosity for software I&apos;ve always
        had. Now we are here, where I can create my own software through code. I get to make cool
        web apps that can be useful tools in solving problems. If I ever need somewhere to write
        notes and save them in the cloud, I can make it. If my friends ever want a personalized site
        for us to chat together, I can make it. If you want a website, I can make it. üò∏‚úåÔ∏è
